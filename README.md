# Social Network API

## Description 

This assignment required me to build out an a social network API application where users are able to share their thoughts. Though, one of the requirements was to react to friends' thoughts, I was unable to get that far given the timeline of the course and it's coming to an end. 

In this assignment, I learned a better understanding of Insomnia, where data is transformed from the controllers and applied to the routes in order to produce, edit and delete data from Insomnia. I overcame many challenges when it came to the user and thought controllers, and overall I feel more confident using a NoSQL database.

## User Story
